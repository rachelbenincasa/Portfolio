This project is a fullstack website, called Coder Kids. The goal of this site was to create a place
for kids to sign up for coding courses, and search by age / skill level to find the right class.

This was a group project, created by myself and Liz Deng. This was done in early 2023.

Some important site functions to mention:
- User creation, including password salting and hashing, and forget password options.
- Filters for classes, such as age groups, skill level, times and dates, and languages.
- "Cart" to add courses to, and a "check out" feature to sign up for them
- Easy course deletion from cart if needed.
- Uses a database to keep track of courses / users


This was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, and SQL.
