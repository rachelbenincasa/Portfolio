<!--
  This page shows up when a user clicks that they forgot their password. it asks them for their username
  and when they click the button, it will send a request to the server to get their security question.
  if the user exists, the security question and an answer box shows up, and if the user enters the correct
  security answer, their password also shows up. also then should probably log in that particular user and
  bring them to the home page where they are logged in.
