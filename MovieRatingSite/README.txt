This project was a full-stack movie rating site. This was created by myself, as well as Vara Vungutar and Pete Habib. A few features include:

- Adding movies using name, picture, notable actors.
- Login / Create Account feature, with cookies for sign-in purposes.
- Ability to click on a movie and give a rating / put a review
- Updates reviews and average rating on the site in real time

This program was done using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MongoDB for the database function. We also used Docker to host our site online, but it is not currently online, to save money.

My role in this project was mainly the JavaScript (code.js), and I also helped with the HTML and CSS for some of the different pages!

I hope you enjoy viewing the project, thank you! :D
