This project is a Pokedex Web application. This was done in my web development course,
at the University of Washington in Spring 2023.

Some site features:
- Populates the pokedex with correct sprites using ajaX
- Displays detailed Pokemon card with sprite is clicked. This includes name, type, HP, and moves
- Created a game view where uses choose a Pokemon and battle an opponent

This was built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. However, the HTML and CSS were given for this project, and I wrote the JavaScript!
