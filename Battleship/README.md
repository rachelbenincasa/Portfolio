Hello! Thank you for viewing this project! This coding project was a fully functional Battleship game, including a GUI.

Some features include:
- Easy vs. Hard Mode AI
- Animations and Sound Effects
- Multiple sound / mode selectors
- Correct and effective logic for moves

This was a group project I was a part of. The other members of the team who created this are:
- Cole Hersh
- Bronson Housmans
- Emma Elliott

This project was done in Java, using JavaFX to create the GUI.

Note: There are a lot of image files, if you would like to see the code itself, just look for the .java files! :)
