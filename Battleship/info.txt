Infomation about Battleship:
Battleship is a turn based strategy game in which the objective is to sink the enemy ships before they sink yours. There are 5 ships per player of various sizes ranging from 2 tiles to 5 tiles. The user will make the first move by clicking a square on the opponent's grid with a noftfication of whether the move was a ship hit or a miss. The user and computer player will then alternate moves until the game is concluded.
Rules:
The user must place their ships within the boundaries of the grid and can not have two ships placed in the same grid location. During the game, the user is able to make their moves but must wait until the CPU has made their moves before guessing again. While it is possible to guess the same location multiple times, this will not affect the game and the user must guess a new postion on the grid for the game to progress. The user also is not able to perform a guess on their own position.
Game Modes:
There are two game modes for this Battleship project: Normal and Salvo. Normal Battleship has the user make one guess on the opponent board and in turn the CPU will make a guess on the player's board. Salvo mode is meant to be a more fast paced game in which the user is able to make a number of guesses per turn based on their number of ships remaining. When a user or CPU ship sinks, they lose a guess for their remaining turns.
